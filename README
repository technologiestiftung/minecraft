You'll need to get the Archive::Zip and Image::Magick perl modules installed. Then you can run the software from a command line using:

./generate-world --postcode SO171BJ --size 1000 Highfield

This usage would create a world file in the /saves/ subdirectory called Highfield centred on the Universty of Southampton and 1000 blocks (1km) square. You may find it handy to symlink the /saves/ directory to your minecraft saves location.

Internet access is essential at all times as this will be downloading lots of data.
